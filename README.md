 Reverse-engineering "Logic" e-cigarette with open-source alternative

## Introduction
I was bored.  
Got a broken spare, but main IC had its pin eaten by corrosion.
Since I can't do bonding-wire-level soldering I decided to sacriface this one.

## Description
The circuit is actually very, *very* simple.  
There are 5 main subcircuits:  
* battery (-) isolation
* output
* charger
* piezo input
* indicator LEDs

The circuit seems a bit messy now. I'm trying to figure out parts used in this.  
Unfortunately finding exact parts will be a bit hard (SOT-xx markings, eh?), but I feel like some people might find something suitable based on their experience.  

## Open Source?
Yeeeeeah. Another project I'm going to start and abandon after a week.
It's nothing hard though. Once "somewhat suitable" parts are found, the rest of the work boils down to redoing the PCB.

Just a schematic. For now. Let's see if this takes off.
